### BCGA Execution with supplied scripts ###

For local execution in serial:
 - Set location to "LOCAL" within "run100" script file
 - Execute "run100" as normal script (./run100)

For BlueBEAR execution in serial:
 - Set location to "LOCAL" within "run100" script file
 - Submit "bluebear.script" to queue (qsub bluebear.script)

For BlueBEAR execution in psuedo-parallel:
 - Set location to "BLUEBEAR" within "run100" script file
 - ensure ppn=1 in bluebear.script
 - Execute "run100" as normal script (./run100)
 - Each GA run will be submitted to queue seperately

For Hypatia execution in serial:
 - Set location to "LOCAL" within "run100" script file
 - Submit "hypatia.script" to queue (qsub hypatia.script)

For Hypatia execution in psuedo-parallel:
 - Set location to "HYPATIA" within "run100" script file
 - ensure ppn=1 in hypatia.script
 - Execute "run100" as normal script (./run100)
 - Each GA run will be submitted to queue seperately

*IMPORTANT FOR PARALLEL LOCAL EXECUTION*
If run sequentially, the processors requested must be the same in the submission script and in the run100 file (but in all honestly, if we are running on a queue system you should be using the psuedo-parallel, in which don't worry!)
