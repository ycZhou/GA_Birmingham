### BCGA Execution with supplied scripts ###

Optimising with the BCGA and NWChem.

This optimises a tiny He-Ne cluster.

Input files:
input: GA optimisation parameters
DFT_NW.in: The force field file (specifies the use of NWChem for energy calculations)
DFT.nw: An NWChem input file, with the coordinates block replaced with the line BCGAcoords.
